# ThirdPersonAssignment
Hi There! In this project I have implemented:<br>
Player Controls- Moves forward, backward, left and right for keys 'W', 'S' , 'A' and 'D'. Jumps when pressed spacebar<br>
Camera Controls with Cinemachine- Have added a virtual camera as well since i wasnt very much familiar with Freelook camera to provide looking around with mouse controls. Yet implemented both<br>
Collectibles- Blue gems added for collection with count/score displayed on the left<br>
Laser beams- to affect Player health and provide damage that enable and disable themselves in some delays increasing difficulty for player and adding more fun<br>
Health bar- Provided on top right to keep a track on health that takes damage whenever it passes through the laser lights.<br>
Cathy 3D enviroment- used Unity assets to implement a minimalistic enviroment like the town, gems<br>
Animations- procided animations to the player for run, die and jump<br>
